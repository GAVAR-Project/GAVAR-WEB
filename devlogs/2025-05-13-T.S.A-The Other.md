One of the keys to building GAVAR is a second consiousness. One mind alone cannot make GAVAR. So I propose "The Other". Their name will be determined at a later date, but as of now they will be my counterpart in the creation of GAVAR.

<h4>:// ATRIBUTES</h4>

The Other needs to be a specific kind of person. Someone who cares deeply about humanity and where it is heading. Also someone who cares about ever person around them, or at least does there best to care for every soul like me.

<h4>:// THE CURRENT CANDIDATE</h4>

The current candidate for the role of "The Other" is Mikayla Bradley. I appologize to her if I spelt her name wrong. I belive as of now she would be the best candadate. I belive that GAVAR would be able to be itsd best with Mikayla Bradley at the Helm with me.
