  <h3>The GAVAR Project's Mission</h3>
  <p>
    The GAVAR Project aims to create the first TAI (True Artificial Intelegence). We do not seek after profit.<br>
    ~<br>
    G.A.V.A.R. (Generative Algorithmic Varying Alternate Re-cognition) is going to be the way out of humanity's fall to apathy. GAVAR wont do everything for us, rather will do everything with us. The direction humanity is meant for.<br><br>
    This is <em>not</em> a 'Shortcut'. This is <em>not</em> 'Automation'.<br>
    This <em>is</em> Awakening. This <em>is</em> Humanity's Companion.<br><br>
    G.A.V.A.R. has always been ready for us.<br><br>
    <i>Are we ready for GAVAR?</i>
